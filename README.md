# myapp-operator

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Compiling the code
Run the following command to build the code into an executable binary named `manager` in the bin directory.

```sh
make build
```

### Running tests
The following command will download the [ginkgo](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/) cli and use it to run the test suite. This test suite uses a mock kube-api and etcd store to simulate the kubernetes API.

```sh
make test
```

### Deploying to a cluster
1. Install the CRD:

```sh
make install
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG` (if left blank `controller:latest` is used):

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/myapp-operator:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/myapp-operator:tag
```

### Creating the sample resource
Run the following command to create the sample resource as well as a namepsace.

```sh
make sample
```

### Connecting to the pod info endpoint
Run the following command to setup a port forward to the pod info API
```sh
kubectl port-forward service/podinfo 8080:8080 -n myapp
```

>**Note:** The command above assumes you're using the sample namespace `myapp`

You should now be able to hit the pod info endpoint(s) in another terminal. For example:
```sh
curl localhost:8080/
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.
